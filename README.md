# Signup Form with Custom Hook and Validation

A React app featuring a signup form that uses a custom hook to manage form inputs, handle validation, and display error messages. The form includes fields for email, password, first name, last name, role, and acquisition channels, with real-time validation applied to the inputs. The app uses a custom hook to simplify handling form state and validation logic, allowing for efficient form handling and error management.
This project demonstrates the use of custom hooks, validation functions, and conditional rendering to manage and validate form inputs dynamically in React.
